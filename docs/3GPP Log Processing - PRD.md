# Product Requirements Document (PRD): 3GPP NAS Log Processing and AI Troubleshooting System

---

## 1. Purpose

To develop a software system that ingests QxDM logs, parses and structures 3GPP NAS signaling data, applies intelligent analysis (including AI/ML), and provides actionable troubleshooting insights to field technicians for efficient resolution of network issues such as attach failures, bearer setup problems, and session drops.

---

## 2. Scope

- **Input**: QxDM logs in text or semi-structured format (<100MB typical size)
- **Output**: Structured CSVs, grouped data, AI-driven diagnostics, and technician-friendly summaries/recommendations
- **Users**: Field technicians, network engineers, support analysts

---

## 3. Objectives & Goals

- Automate NAS log parsing and structuring
- Group messages by logical procedures, message types, and sessions
- Detect anomalies and common failure patterns using AI/ML
- Provide root cause analysis and troubleshooting guidance
- Enable easy data exploration, visualization, and export
- Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) for network issues
- Support extensibility for new NAS fields, message types, and AI models

---

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Log Ingestion & Preprocessing
- Accept QxDM logs in text or CSV format
- Support batch uploads and versioned storage
- Preprocess proprietary/binary logs via vendor tools (out of scope for initial release)

### 4.2. Parsing & Field Extraction
- Extract fields: timestamp, direction, message type, procedure, bearer/APN/IP/QCI, GUTI/MME/TMSI, security capabilities, cause codes, etc. (some fields optional)
- Normalize and validate extracted data
- Output a normalized CSV (`nas_events_expanded.csv`)

### 4.3. Data Grouping & Sessionization
- Group messages by:
  - NAS procÃ©dure (Attach, Detach, TAU, Service Request, Bearer Management, etc.)
  - Message type
  - Session/transaction (GUTI + Bearer ID, IMSI), handling incomplete sessions
  - Direction (UE-to-Network, Network-to-UE)
- Output grouped CSVs with clear naming

### 4.4. AI/ML-Driven Analysis
- Anomaly detection (e.g., timing, sequence anomalies) using AI/ML
- Root cause classification for failed procedures (using ML and rule-based logic)
- Automated troubleshooting recommendations mapped to detected issues
- Natural language summaries of sessions and failures (NLP/LLM integration)
- Pattern recognition and clustering for recurring issues

### 4.5. User Interaction & Reporting
- CLI and/or web dashboard with customizable reports for:
  - Uploading logs
  - Viewing grouped data and AI findings
  - Downloading CSVs and summaries
- Technician feedback loop for continuous AI improvement

### 4.6. Extensibility & Automation
- Modular codebase for easy addition of new fields, groupings, and AI models
- Unit and integration tests for all modules
- Pipeline automation with API support for batch processing and integrations

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Process logs (<100MB) in under 2 minutes; support larger logs/concurrent processing
- **Scalability**: Handle batch and concurrent processing efficiently
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and logging
- **Security**: Protect sensitive data, comply with GDPR/HIPAA
- **Maintainability**: Well-documented, modular, and testable codebase

---

## 6. Success Metrics

- >90% accuracy in field extraction and grouping
- >80% precision/recall in anomaly and root cause detection (measured on labeled data)
- >50% reduction in average troubleshooting time (pilot study)
- >75% user satisfaction/adoption rate

---

## 7. Out of Scope

- Direct parsing of proprietary binary QxDM formats
- Real-time log streaming (batch mode only)
- Integration with external ticketing or OSS/BSS systems (future roadmap)

---

## 8. User Personas

- **Field Technician**: Needs quick, actionable insights from logs to resolve issues on-site.
- **Network Engineer**: Requires detailed analysis and root cause identification for systemic issues.

---

## 9. Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib
- **Storage**: CSV, optional database integration

---

## 10. Glossary

- **NAS**: Non-Access Stratum
- **QxDM**: Qualcomm Diagnostic Monitor
- **GUTI**: Globally Unique Temporary Identifier

---

## 11. Milestones & Deliverables

1. **MVP**: Parsing, grouping, and CSV export
2. **AI/ML Integration**: Anomaly/root cause detection, recommendations
3. **User Interface**: CLI and/or web dashboard
4. **Feedback Loop**: Technician feedback and model retraining
5. **Documentation & Training Materials**
